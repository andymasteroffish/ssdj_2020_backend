This is a node server that runs this game. The compainion frontend repo is here: https://github.com/andymasteroffish/ssdj_2020_frontend

The Heroku project is here: ssdj-game.herokuapp.com
To connet to the websocket use ws://ssdj-game.herokuapp.com:80
(Heroku apps are always on port 80)

This is its own repo because heroku wants the app in the root directory.

Use `npm start` to test locally
